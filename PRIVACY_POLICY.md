# Privacy Policy for WeightLog

**Effective Date:** January 16, 2026

## 1. Introduction
WeightLog ("we," "our," or "us") is dedicated to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our application operates and confirms that we do not collect, use, or share your personal information.

## 2. Data Collection and Use
WeightLog is designed as a fully private application.
- **No Data Collection:** We do not collect, transmit, or store any of your personal data on our servers.
- **Local Storage:** All weight logs and associated data are stored locally on your device or within your own personal Google Sheets if you choose to enable that feature.

## 3. Third-Party Services
Our application allows you to integrate with your personal Google Drive (Google Sheets) for data backup and tracking.
- **Google Sign-In:** This service is used solely to authenticate you with Google and grant the application permission to access the specific spreadsheet you notate for weight logging.
- **Google Sheets:** Data you log is written directly to your personal Google Sheet. We do not have access to this data; it remains strictly between the application on your device and your Google Account.

## 4. Data Security
Since we do not collect or hold your data, the security of your information relies on the security of your device and your Google Account. We recommend securing your device and using strong passwords for your accounts.

## 5. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes.
